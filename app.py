st.markdown("""
Welcome to the Animal Kingdom! Here, we learn about **division** by helping animals share their treats.

Division is all about **fair sharing** and figuring out if anything is left over. It's a key math skill used every day, from sharing a pizza to organizing a team.

---

### üéØ Objective:
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Understand division as fair sharing among groups.
- Identify the **quotient** (the result of sharing) and the **remainder** (what's left over).
- Apply division to solve real-world problems.
- Relate these concepts to Common Core math standards.
